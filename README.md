## 📝 About the Project

### 🏦 Bank Churn Prediction

#### 📌 Problem Statement

In the world of banking, retaining customers is crucial. Banks face the challenge of 'Churn,' where customers leave for competitors. Understanding the factors influencing this decision helps in strategizing to improve service and reduce churn.

#### 🎯 Objective

The goal is to **build a neural network-based classifier** that predicts whether a bank customer will leave in the next 6 months. By accurately identifying potential churn, banks can take proactive steps to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
